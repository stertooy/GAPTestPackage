<Heading>Installation</Heading>

 You can download &PACKAGENAME; as a .tar.gz archive
 <URL Text='here'>&ARCHIVEURL;.tar.gz</URL>. After extracting, you should
 place it in a suitable <F>pkg</F> folder. For example, on a Debian-based
 Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint), you can place it in
 <F>&dollar;HOME/.gap/pkg</F> (recommended) which makes it available for just
 yourself, or in the &GAP; installation directory (<F>gap-X.Y.Z/pkg</F>)
 which makes it available for all users.
<P/>
 You can use the following command to efficiently install the package for
 yourself:
 <Listing Type="Command">wget -qO- https://[...].tar.gz | tar xzf - --one-top-level=&dollar;HOME/.gap/pkg</Listing>
 If the &PackageManager; package is installed and loaded, you can install
 &PACKAGENAME; from within a &GAP; session
 using <Ref Func="InstallPackage" BookName="PackageManager" Style="Number"/>.
